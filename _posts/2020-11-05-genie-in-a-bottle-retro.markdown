When hosting a retrospective, I look for a format that beautifully fits with the goal I try to achieve. For this one, I wanted to focus on a few wishes that the team-mates had, and make them come true through cooperation.

# The format
### 1. Icebreaker
To get in the mood of the theme, I asked the team-members to share how they feel about wishing and superstition. This text was visible on the board that I had prepared:
> What do you value about doing a wish ? Is there nostalgia involved ? Do you believe wishes can come true ? Do you need to pose your wish to a genie, a magician, the stars, ... ? Answer with a picture / quote / anecdote / ...*

### 2. Pick a color
For the upcoming steps, I wanted to be able to see who posted which wish and who voted for what. Therefore, the board was lined up with colorful post-its, and each person had to choose a color. The instructions were simple:
>Just be first to write your name on your favorite color

### 3. Make a wish for yourself
>What would make you happier at work ? Would you like to learn more on the job ? Do you want to contribute more on something ? Would you like people to behave differently to you ?

### 4. Make a wish for the team. A short term goal.
>If you could magically change something in the way this team works - what would it be ?

### 5. Make a wish for the team. A long term goal.
>Go wild. What would be a great goal to strive for ?

### 6. Now you're the genie. What wish do you want to make come true ?
>You must serve 1 wish of each category. You can't serve a wish you posted yourself.

### 7. What will the committee of genies do ?

Individual wishes -> just get together.

Team wishes -> find actions to advance on most-voted items.

### 8. Wrap up
>How do you rate this retro ? Who is next ?

Inspiration for this format mostly came from the [Genie in a Bottle](https://retromat.org/en/?id=116) format on retromat.org
