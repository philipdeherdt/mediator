We recently did a remote team-building that involved answering fun icebreaker-questions. I liked the session, but wanted to turn it into something better. This team-quiz is the result.


You may know the kind of questions: "If you could have 1 superpower, which would it be ?" or "Which 3 items would you want to have when being stranded on a deserted island?". Or look for "icebreaker questions" to find a whole bunch of them.

I absolutely like the idea, but I have a few issues with them:
* They're too hypothetical for me. *End up on a deserted island ? I don't even know how I would get into that situation, so how would I know to get out of it again ?*
* They're out of my knowledge-area. *A super-hero that reminds me of the last sprint ? I don't read comic-books and didn't recently watch a superhero-movie. Therefore I have to pick 1 that pops up in my head, and try to remember something about his/her magic superhero powers.*
* They require a good memory *My favourite high-school teacher? I'd need a few minutes to come up with a name.*
* Other people may not have a good answer either. And we all need to wait/listen for everyone's response, because we want everyone to be heard.
* Interactivity. Typically everyone just gives an answer, and then you move to the next topic.

I won't fix all of those with the team-quiz. But I do prefer the quiz-version!

# Rules
* do This
* and that

# Practicalities
* postits
* tracking score

# Good and bad questions
- guidelines
- examples

# Advantages
- The quizmaster can compete as well.
- There could be a rotating role for the quizmaster (if multiple people prepared questions)
- It's an opportunity to build trust in the team (because keeping track of the score is up to each individual)
- Lightweight arguments could arise (because some things are intentionally clear from the start)
- It could be a team-practice on decision-making (if a rule is unclear, the team has to find a solution)
