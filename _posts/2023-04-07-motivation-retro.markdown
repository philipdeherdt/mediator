# Introduction
We recently had a reading group on the book [Motiveren zonder controleren](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58460984-motiveren-zonder-controleren){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a book about [Self-determination theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and applying it to a company environment.
Since I enjoy creating my own meeting formats and I was interested in improving the team's happiness from a cooperation and motivation angle, I turned the chapter "ABC-proof job design" into a retrospective. I think that this format is most useful if you notice a bit of demotivation in the team and want people to speak about it openly and do something about it.

# The format: getting started
* [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/cegeka1863/m/cegeka1863/1680873595096/0c38d0cf3763d9117e720d5f55fc45062df10f0b){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (the square stickies were added during the session.)
* groups of 3
* preparation
* Timeblock : 1h30m

# Step 1: Icebreaker
: naam op map plaatsen	(10 min)
	* cosy evening with partner or friend(s). Where would you go to sit ?  |  As you put your name post-it, say why you like that spot.

# Step 2: Brief introduction to self-determination theory

* Intro (15 min)
	* SDT + ABC duiden
	* motivators kaderen (en demotivators negeren, want kort time-format)

# Step 3: Select 1 motivator per person 
* Prep (5-10 min)
		* select 1 that you miss most  DURING: Define subgroups during prep

# Step 4: Idea generation
* Idea generation (15min)
	* In Groups of 3 (define via Circle proximity greedy) ; make 1 or 2 groups of 2 people if your headcount isn't divisible by 3.
	* explain the troika consulting format.
	* discuss ideas for both. through [Troika Consulting](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/8-troika-consulting/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (5min pp) => list potential actions or 'should be situations' that sound like a solution -> maximum of 2 best suggestions (if doing remote, aim to have the possibility for the host to jump into calls. No slack private huddles please. Assist on following the troika format.)

# Step 5: Clarify ideas to group
* Going over them (5-10min)
	* Per motivator (high -> low)
	* Does group agree on suggestion (fist of 5) -> ranking

# Step 6: Make them actionable
* Make actionable (15-20min)
	* highest ranked items
	* SMART   ||   team vision that we agree on together + make SMART over time

# Step 7: The end
(5min) 
Round robin : was this retrospective useful for you ?
