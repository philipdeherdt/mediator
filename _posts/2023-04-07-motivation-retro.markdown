# Introduction
We recently had a reading group on the book [Motiveren zonder controleren](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58460984-motiveren-zonder-controleren){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, a book about [Self-determination theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} and applying it to a company environment.
Since I enjoy creating my own meeting formats and I was interested in improving the team's happiness from a cooperation and motivation angle, I turned the chapter *ABC-proof job design* into a retrospective. I think that this format is most useful if you notice a bit of demotivation in the team and want people to speak about it openly and do something about it.

# About the format
* My version of the retro was held for a remote team. Therefore, I worked with a [digital whiteboard](https://app.mural.co/t/cegeka1863/m/cegeka1863/1680873595096/0c38d0cf3763d9117e720d5f55fc45062df10f0b){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (all the square stickies are there to indicate what people might add during the session.)
* This format involves splitting the team up into groups of 3 (or 2) people. Therefore, it's best to foresee break-out rooms or a physical location with some distinct areas.
* Suggested total duration of this retro is 1h30m

# Step 1: Icebreaker (10 min)

As an icebreaker, I wanted people to put their name somewhere in a 2d area (you'll find out why in step #4). As a way of doing this fairly randomly, I posted this image and asked people to put a sticky with their name on through this logic:

*Imagine that you have a cosy summer's evening out with your partner or a small group of friend(s). Where would you go to sit ? As you put your name on the map, say out loud why you choose that spot.*

# Step 2: The theory (15 min)
As knowledge-sharing and clarification of what was comuning up next, I gave a brief introduction to self-determination.

The first part was about indicating what the word 'motivation' means, explaining which 3 basic psychological needs all people share and about the three ways you can adapt your working environment so that your basic needs are better fulfilled.

To keep the retro bite-size, I opted to skip *challenges* and *job demands* after shortly informing the team about their existence.

The second part of the theory was there to make sure that people knew what *Job resources* actually were. There doesn't seem to be one agreed-upon list of job resources, so I picked 8 that I thought would be most likely to occur within the team. For completeness, I mentioned that those 8 were not a complete list, but in the remainder of the retro, only those 8 would be in scope.

# Step 3: Select main motivator (5-10 min)

After the theory, it was up to each teammember to select which job resource they miss most and indicate that on the image for this round.

While the team members are choosing their job resource, the facilitator has some time to split the team into groups of 2 or (preferably) 3 people for the next round. The facilitator can do this by pairing up people who sit near each other on the icebreaker-map. I suggest to make the grouping visual to avoid confusion in the next step.

# Step 4: Idea generation (15 min)
If your team doesn't have much experience yet with *Liberating structures*, you first may want to introduce them to the format of [Troika Consulting](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/8-troika-consulting/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.


(5min pp) => list potential actions or 'should be situations' that sound like a solution -> maximum of 2 best suggestions (if doing remote, aim to have the possibility for the host to jump into calls. No slack private huddles please. Assist on following the troika format.)

# Step 5: Clarify ideas to group

![](/prettydamnhot/assets/post_images/motivation/4.png)
* Going over them (5-10min)
	* Per motivator (high -> low)
	* Does group agree on suggestion (fist of 5) -> ranking

# Step 6: Make them actionable
* Make actionable (15-20min)
	* highest ranked items
	* SMART   ||   team vision that we agree on together + make SMART over time

# Step 7: The end
(5min) 
Round robin : was this retrospective useful for you ? 

# Evaluation
