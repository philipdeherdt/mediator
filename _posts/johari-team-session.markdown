turn into practical format
suitable for remote team


# The format
### 1. Introduction:
I told the team why I chose this format. We're a distributed team. I had the feeling that communication was pretty good already, but wanted to confirm that feeling.

### 2. Icebreaker:
Ask the team-members to tell about their recent happy-moment (something they did or encountered recently - either on or off work - that made them feel good and they consider part of their personality) [Goal: start talking about yourself with a positive mindset]

### 3. Getting started:

- Give an introduction on the Johari window, and let people fill in their own sheet on [kevan.org/johari](kevan.org/johari) + share the URL on a Trello board
- Let people fill in the sheet of their left + right neighbour [So, you want people sitting in a circle. When distributed, you could consider the screen a portal, and let the circle continue that way; or do circles per location (depending on what you do in the next steps)

### 4. Some theory:

- Some theory: explain how you ideally want to move items into the Arena (= known to self + others), and how you need the next 2 types of communication to do that.

### 5. Exercises:

- Exercise 1: moving items from Blind Spot to Arena by giving feedback: ask every team-member to tell to the neighbour on his right why you selected an item that's in his blind spot. [If there's an even amount of people, it might be more useful to have the people form pairs and give this feedback to each-other.]
- Exercise 2: moving items from Facade to Arena by opening up: ask every team-member to tell to the neighbour on his left why he considers an item in his Facade to be part of his personality.


### 6. Closing:
- End of retro: ask the team how they felt talking about this with their neighbours + ask if they would like if more colleagues would give feedback through their Johari profile (you might want to encourage this, because feedback from 2 people isn't that much yet)


# Lessons learned

- Team communication was as good as I imagined, making for lots of fun and good feedback during the retro.
- Because our team's communication is good, I should have asked team-members to share with the group what they've learned about themselves.
- In a distributed setup, you might want to bring headsets and setup private calls to give feedback to people 'on the other side' in a 1-on-1 way.
- The holiday period is not ideal for this type of retro (because it's likely that not all team-members are present, and you should do this exercise with the full team)
- By talking about the items in Facade and Blind Spot, I noticed that you often pick different terms for the same behaviour (not just synonyms, also combos like adaptable-relaxed) => Key take-away: Don't just fill in the Johari, but talk about it afterwards ! (edited)

- In a team that has been going for a longer time, the [Nohari](https://kevan.org/nohari) variant might be more interesting.

# Thanks
I wouldn't have done this format without the online [Interactive Johari Window](kevan.org/johari).
